This dataset contains information about mobile apps in AppStore and Google Play that can be downloaded and installed for free. Knowing the number of people using these apps, we can estimate the revenue, as the main source of revenue for free mobile apps is in-app advertising, and it mainly depends on the number of users using our app.

The main purpose of this analysis is to identify the most attractive apps and then provide this information to developers for further development.
